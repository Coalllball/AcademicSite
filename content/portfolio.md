# <font> <center>[Civic Aircraft Traffic Routes Above Manhattan]({{< ref "post/civic-aircraft-traffic-routes-above-manhattan/index.md" >}}) </center></font>

My friend Ziqi Wang and I have collaborated on this project, inspired by her internship experience at BetaNYC where she was assigned to build a dashboard displaying the distribution of helicopters in the air over Manhattan, but the project was left unfinished due to technical issues. We aimed to expand the scope and content of the project using Python for data collection and cleaning, gathering data from the OpenSky API on helicopter routes. Using ArcGIS, we created a 3D map that highlights the impact of helicopter noise on the city's residents and identifies the areas that are most affected by it. Our goal is to raise awareness about the issue and make a practical impact with this exercise.

Living in New York City comes with its challenges, with high housing expenses being a significant burden on residents. As someone who calls the city home, I am all too familiar with the struggles of trying to afford a place to live. Unfortunately, despite the government's efforts to address the issue with the affordable housing campaign, rental prices continue to rise. The average rental price for a one-bedroom apartment in NYC has increased by 41% since the previous year, according to a report by zumper.com.

Despite this, the latest affordable housing plan launched in 2014 aims to provide below-market rents and prevent homelessness. However, with the U.S. Census Bureau predicting a population decline of 320,000 in New York State in 2021, it is unclear whether the program has had a positive impact on residents. As an analyst, I aim to use data analysis and mapping techniques to examine the effectiveness of the program and present my findings visually. By doing so, I hope to gain insights into the impact of the affordable housing plan on New Yorkers.

In this project, I took a brief look at Netflix's database and how it was structured. I explored the different types of data stored, such as movie and TV show titles, ratings, and user profiles. I also touched on the challenges of managing and analyzing such a massive dataset. By examining the database structure, I aimed to give readers a better understanding of how Netflix operates and the complexity involved in delivering personalized recommendations to millions of users.

Nowadays, the flourishing of Internet technology and its development have led to an explosion of data. Big Data has been closely integrated with the social activities of the general public, which in part raises the threat to personal privacy. It is not novel that personal privacy information is traded as a commodity in the market. This paper examines deficiencies of the current centralized information exchange model, and focuses on analyzing the user agreements provided by Internet service companies to interpret their influence on users' information behavior. The paper also presents a brief overview of the current state of national legislation on privacy protection and the potential solutions considered by academics. The paper argues that, firstly, the Internet security environment is further degraded by the fact that Internet service providers accumulate too much users' private data under the existing information exchange model. Secondly, user agreements have the intention to force users to avoid information. Ultimately, legislation and regulation should be adapted to the actual situation of users' information needs in order to guide companies to raise users' awareness of their rights.

I was part of a team creating a website to explore the multifaceted uses of VR technology. Each of us chose 1-2 topics related to VR and developed content for a standalone page. We aimed to showcase VR's potential in various areas, including arts, education, and space exploration. The team consisted of my friends who are also in DAV program, Ziqi, Sara, and Tk.

# <center>Database Solution for Indie Game Studio</center>

Our team designed a database for an hypothetical indie game studio to centralize business operational data and solve challenges faced by their marketing team. We incorporated client lists, marketing project lists, game release and sales data, and supply chain data to ensure timely and reliable information for managing client relationships and projects. Our database also includes financial data to prevent budget overreach and guide future marketing projects. The solution ensures data security, enhances data quality, and reduces redundancies and inconsistencies.

This project was conducted with my teammates from Information Architecture class. We focused on improving the site's accessibility, navigation, and overall user experience for both current and prospective caregivers. Our team conducted user research and incorporated feedback from focus groups to create a design that met the needs of the organization's target audience. We also implemented a new content management system to streamline the site's maintenance and improve its scalability. Ultimately, our redesign successfully addressed the organization's needs and we believe it will provid a positive experience for its users.
