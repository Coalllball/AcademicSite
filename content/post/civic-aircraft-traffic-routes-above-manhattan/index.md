## Introduction

This project is a collaboretion with my friend Ziqi Wang, and inspired with her experience during her intership at BetaNYC during summer. She were required to build a dashboard to demostrate the distribution of helicopters in air of Manhattan. The project was not finished due to technical difficulties and I decided to join and finish it.
