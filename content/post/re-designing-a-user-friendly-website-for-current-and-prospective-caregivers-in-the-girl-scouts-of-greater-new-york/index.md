As a well-established organization with a rich history, the Girl Scouts of Greater New York have a wealth of information on their website. However, the complex structure of the website can make it difficult for current and prospective caregivers to find the information they need. Our team's goal is to understand the information needs of caregivers and redesign the website to better meet those needs by reorganizing the information on the website and implement visual design elements to make it easier for caregivers to find what they are looking for.

## Know the Users

As designers, it is essential that we understand the needs and preferences of our users before we begin any design work. To gather this information, we conducted user research using three methods: interviews, card sorting, and tree testing. These methods allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of our users' needs and helped us to structure the website content in a way that better meets those needs.

### What information do Caregivers care the most? 

When deciding whether to register their children in an extracurricular program, caregivers are likely to be interested in several key aspects of the program. These can be summarized into five main categories:

1. Information about the programs: Caregivers will want to know details about the programs being offered, including the age range of children who can participate, the activities offered, and any additional information about the program.
2. Location and accessibility: Caregivers will need to know where the program is located and how to get there. They may also be interested in transportation options or discounts for families living in certain areas.
3. Cost and financial assistance: Caregivers will need to know the cost of the program and whether financial assistance is available.
4. Testimonials or reviews: Caregivers may find it helpful to read reviews or testimonials from other parents who have enrolled their children in the program.
5. Ways to give back: Caregivers may be interested in learning about ways they can contribute to the program or organization, such as volunteering or making donations.

In addition to the content itself, users also appreciate a website that is easy to navigate and has a clear, organized layout. This makes it easier for them to find the information they are looking for and to use the website effectively
