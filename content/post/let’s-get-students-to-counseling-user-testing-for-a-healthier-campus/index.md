## Introduction


As a member of a team of five student researchers, I'm excited to share our experience in a UX project to improve the usability of the Pratt Institute website! Our client, Pratt Institute, is a prestigious arts college located in Brooklyn, New York. We aimed to improve the user experience of students accessing critical information on the Institute's Health Services, Counseling Center, and Resilience, Health and Wellness web pages. This article will describe the goals and scope of the project, our methodology, the process we followed, the issues we identified, our recommendations, and the conclusions of the project.

## Goals and Scope

Pratt Institute approached our team to identify usability issues with their health and wellness web pages and to provide recommendations to enhance the overall user experience. Pratt Institute is currently working to become a JED Campus, a program designed by the Jed Foundation to guide the school's efforts in existing student mental health, substance use, and suicide prevention through comprehensive systems, program, and policy development. Therefore, it was critical to test the Pratt website to ensure that students and other users could easily find these resources. The pages we focused on included the Counseling Center, Health and Safety, and Resilience, Health and Wellness pages. Initially, the scope of the project included students, teachers, and parents, and assessed whether multilingual support would be beneficial for non-native English speakers. However, due to time constraints, we narrowed our target group to undergraduate students.
