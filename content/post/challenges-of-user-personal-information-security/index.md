Introduction\
In recent years, with the development of the Internet industry and the broad adoption of Big Data\
technologies, the public has become increasingly concerned about the topic of personal information\
protection. Whereas ten years ago, when people were not aware of the value of personal information,\
more of them were willing to trade their privacy for more convenient services. The attitudes toward\
personal information in the two eras are dramatically opposed.\
Among the growing challenges to Internet security, previously highly prized Internet\
companies have been thrust into the front burner of public opinion. Questions have been raised over\
the means and purposes of collecting personal information from users by these technology giants.\
One of the most widely criticized is the so-called "The Biggest Lie on the Internet,‚Äù (Obar & Oeldorf-\
Hirsch, 2018) which is the user agreement and privacy policy provided by various Internet application\
developers.\
Although various national and regional governments have been promoting their own\
personal information protection regulations over the years to restrict the harvesting and processing\
of users' personal information from Internet companies, by explicitly stipulating that application\
service providers must publicly specify in their user agreements and privacy policy documents the\
types of personal information collected through their services, how it is collected, and the purposes\
for which it is used. However, the reality is that these legal documents are often unnecessarily\
complicated and obscure, and most users do not pay attention to these contents. As a result, users\
unknowingly waive their rights and are unable to protect their personal information effectively.\
Therefore, this paper will focus on the privacy policies of Internet companies and their user\
agreements with customers, analyze the conflicts between companies and customers regarding the\
security of personal information, and explore the purposes and methods of companies in controlling\
customers' privacy. Second, this paper will briefly introduce the existing approaches to personal\
information protection in various countries as well as compare and analyze their similarities and\
differences. Finally, this paper will outline what academics consider as potential measures to address\
privacy protection issues.
