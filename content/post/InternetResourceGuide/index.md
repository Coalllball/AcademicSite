## FRONT MATTER

This section provides a brief description of the guide's contents including, whom it is intended for, what the guide assumes users know, how the guide is organized for use, and tips for users when using the guide. 

### What is in this Guide

The purpose of "INTERNET RESOURCE GUIDE FOR STATISTICS STUDENTS" is to help undergraduate statistics students use internet resources that will help them succeed in the professional field. The guide contains important information and descriptions of resources about two professional organizations, two statistics publications, two online courses and tutorials, and government resources. The resources mentioned in this guide are fully available online, and the guide provides helpful tips for each of them.  

### Who are the Audiences

This guide was created for undergraduate students of Pennsylvania State University who are majoring in Statistics or interest to enroll in statistics major. Many contents require a PSU student account to gain access. The guide covers a wide range of statistics topics from basic concepts to each of its specific applications in particular fields that will prepare new statistics students in academics. Senior students are also benefited from this guide as review material. At the same time, this guide also includes information on professional research websites and organizations, which will help statistics students.

### Science & Tech Spotlight: Contact Tracing Apps

*Sample Document*

**Location:**

https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/708405.pdf

**Description:**

The article introduces a possible idea of contact tracing apps, that could help reduce transmission rates during pandemic like the COVID-19 by identifying and notifying people who may have been exposed. The concept of contact tracing apps bases on the fact in the public health field that tracking possible infected people and asking them to take actions such as self-quarantine can significantly limit disease transmission in the population. The principle of contact tracking apps is simple. The app exchanges a unique code between two individuals who have recent contact and alerts the other person if one of them is infected for further actions to prevent the spread of the disease. However, the article points out some challenges about the accuracy, adoption rates, and privacy concerns that need policy supports to bring out the app’s full potential.
